Tail Segments Video Analysis
============================
This package contains a tracker for locating mouse tails in microscope videos.
The algorithm locates tails in a given video and follows them over time.
It also locates the center line of the tail and does line scans on both sides,
which can then be plotted as kymographs for further analysis.

This package depends on the video-analysis package.


TODO
----
* produce plot after manually aligning
* do something about touching tails
* think about adding a GUI for determining line scan parameters
* Plot extrapolated centerline
